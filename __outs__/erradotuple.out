==4752== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==4752== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,
==4752== or are doing some strange experiment):

==4752== 
==4752== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==4752==   /path/to/gdb ./program.out
==4752== and then give GDB the following command
==4752==   target remote | /usr/local/Cellar/valgrind/HEAD-6049595/lib/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=4752
==4752== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running
