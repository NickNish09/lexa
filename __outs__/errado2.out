==4668== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==4668== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,
==4668== or are doing some strange experiment):

==4668== 
==4668== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==4668==   /path/to/gdb ./program.out
==4668== and then give GDB the following command
==4668==   target remote | /usr/local/Cellar/valgrind/HEAD-6049595/lib/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=4668
==4668== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running
