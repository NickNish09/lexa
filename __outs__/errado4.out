==4708== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==4708== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,
==4708== or are doing some strange experiment):

==4708== 
==4708== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==4708==   /path/to/gdb ./program.out
==4708== and then give GDB the following command
==4708==   target remote | /usr/local/Cellar/valgrind/HEAD-6049595/lib/valgrind/../../bin/vgdb --pid=4708
==4708== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running
