==4730== TO CONTROL THIS PROCESS USING vgdb (which you probably
==4730== don't want to do, unless you know exactly what you're doing,
==4730== or are doing some strange experiment):

==4730== 
==4730== TO DEBUG THIS PROCESS USING GDB: start GDB like this
==4730==   /path/to/gdb ./program.out
==4730== and then give GDB the following command

==4730== --pid is optional if only one valgrind process is running
